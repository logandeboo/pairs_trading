    "One initial observation here is that applying the cointegration test over 5 years results in a very low frequency spread meaning there are generally fewer trading opportunities per year. This is potentially a good thing in the sense that it can be exploited to navigate the 10 day calendar hold restriction. Another observation is that the number of relationships to pair trade is combinatorally massive. The number of possible pairs is given by n(n-1)/2 and each of those pairs can be tested for cointegration at different time intervals. Obviously most won't be cointegrated but it provides optimism that perhaps there are pockets of the market where this strategy is not completely arb'd away."
